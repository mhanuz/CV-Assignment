Explanation of best choosen parameter

1. Adaptive mean thresholding
>>> The background is almost removed
>>> The edge is clear 
>>> The berry is almost black except some region (around 15%) 
>>> the stick of the berry is bit clear 

2. Adaptive Gaussian thresholding
>>> The background is almost removed and better than Adaptive mean thresholding
>>> The edge and contour is clear around 5% contour is connected with noise which is left side on the image
>>> Although around 25% is white but it is inside the berry not affect the contour part 
>>> Finally, the stick of the berry is bit clear
